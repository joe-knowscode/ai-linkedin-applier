# ai-linkedin-applier

The AI LinkedIn Applier which adjusts your Resume based on the job descripton provided -- updating the Projects & Technical Skills Section of your Resume ðŸ”¥

The AI scraper will:
1. Go through job postings one-by-one on LinkedIn.
2. Read the job description of the posting, and send it the LLM.
3. The LLM will output a new `Projects` & `Technical Skills` section for your Resume in Latex format.
4. The LLM output will get pasted on your Resume, on Overleaf -> and will recompile & save your new Resume as a PDF.
5. The scraper will go back to LinkedIn and apply to the job with your new Resume ðŸ’Ž
6. The scraper will give you 60 seconds (adjustable in the code), to fill out any additional questions on the LinkedIn
application. 
7. Once you click `Submit application` you don't need to do anything else, steps 1-6 will repeat on auto-pilot ðŸ˜Ž.

## Simple Pre-requisites
1. [Ollama](https://ollama.com). For running the LLM locally on your machine. *Note:* I may make a separate branch which uses HuggingFace for the LLM call.
2. A Resume on Overleaf which follows the popular [Jake's Resume Format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).
